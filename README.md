>> - **<span style="color: green;">Interpreted Language</span>:** Interpreters process programs a little bit at a time, reading lines and performing computations. An example of this is Python
>> - **<span style="color: green;">Compiled Language</span>:** A Compiler reads the whole program at once, and then translates it completely into machine code, before starting to run the program. Examples are: Java, SQL, C++

>**<h2>Levels of Programming Languages</h2>**
>There are two levels of programming language:
>> - **<span style="color: green;">Low-Level</span>**: Also known as "**<span style="color: green;">Machine Language</span>:**", this level is the most easily understood by computers. It translates instructions into binary code, then runs the program. It's harder to for people to understand
>> - **<span style="color: green;">High-Level</span>:**: More like a natural language; quicker to write, shorter in length and easier to read; more likely to be without error
>**<h2>What Is a Programmer?</h2>**
>> A <span style="color: orange;">computer programmer</span> is an individual who creates/writes computer programs. They are creators, problem solvers, and critical thinkers.

>**<h2>How Do You Code Python?</h2>**
>>Python is typically written by using either:
>> - **<span style="color: green;">Integrated Development Environment</span>** or **<span style="color: green;">IDE</span>**: We will be using the VS Code IDE throughout this cohort
>> - **<span style="color: green;">Command-line Interpreter</span>** or **<span style="color: green;">CLI Interpreter</span>**: This is a built-in option that comes with Python. It allows the programmer to run Python commands and execute Python files.
>>
>>When executing Python code in either environment, the computer will follow the **<span style="color: magenta;">REPL</span>** method.
>> - **<span style="color: magenta;">R</span>eads** the command you entered
>> - **<span style="color: magenta;">E</span>valuates** and executes the command
>> - **<span style="color: magenta;">P</span>rints** the output to the console (if the program calls for it)
>> - **<span style="color: magenta;">L</span>oops** back and repeats the process
