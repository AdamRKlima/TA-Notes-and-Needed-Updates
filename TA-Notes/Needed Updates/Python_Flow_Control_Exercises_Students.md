# Python Flow Control Exercises


## Create a new Jupyter Notebook in your Activities Repo and name it Python Flow Control Exercise. Once you have done that, create a new python code block for your first question. Each question should have their own block, so don't forget to add another block when you're done. Also it is a good idea to create comments on problems that you may have difficulties with. More than likely it will show up in your homework. Now lets get started!

### 1. Using a for loop write a block of Python code so that your output looks like:

### 2. Using a while loop, try getting the same results



### 3. Using a for statement and a nested if statement, create a block of code that shows the numbers that are divisible by 4. For this use the range from 1-100



### 4. Using the string "Python is pretty awesome. I can't wait to LEARN more", print each vowel by using a for and nested if statement



### 5. using the following, print out all combinations of cars and colors
### cars = ['Corvette', 'Camaro', 'Mustang', 'Viper', 'Charger']
### colors = ['Ruby Red', 'Python Green', 'Java Brown', 'C++ Yellow', 'Full Stack Rainbow','Savvy Coders Blue']



### 6. What is the first step in using a module?



### 7 Write a block of code that does the following
### - Asks for the users year of birth
### - Returns: "Your body really hurts" for users born before 1980,"Your back hurts" for users born between the start of 1980 and the end 0f 1989, "Your back is starting to hurt" for users born between the beginning of 1990 and the end of 1999, and "Take care of your body so it doesn't hurt" for all users born after the start of 2000
