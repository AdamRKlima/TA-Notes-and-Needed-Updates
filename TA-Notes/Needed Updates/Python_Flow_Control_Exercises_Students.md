# Python Flow Control Exercises


## Create a new Jupyter Notebook in your Activities Repo and name it Python Flow Control Exercise. Once you have done that, create a new python code block for your first question. Each question should have their own block, so don't forget to add another block when you're done. Also it is a good idea to create comments on problems that you may have difficulties with. More than likely it will show up in your homework. Now lets get started!

### 1. Using a for loop write a block of Python code so that your output looks like:

### 2. Using a while loop, try getting the same results



### 3. Using a for statement and a nested if statement, create a block of code that shows the numbers that are divisible by 4. For this use the range from 1-100



### 4. Using the string "Python is pretty awesome. I can't wait to LEARN more", print each vowel by using a for and nested if statement



### 5. using the following, print out all combinations of cars and colors
### cars = ['Corvette', 'Camaro', 'Mustang', 'Viper', 'Charger']
### colors = ['Ruby Red', 'Python Green', 'Java Brown', 'C++ Yellow', 'Full Stack Rainbow','Savvy Coders Blue']
