**<h1>Python Programming Language</h1>**
> **<h2>Coding At a Glance</h2>** 
>> To understand python, you must first realize how the operation of a program is carried out. To accomplish this, there are two languages that computers use to process the written code
>
> **<h2>Programs and Algorithms, What are They?</h2>**
>> - **<span style="color: green;">Algorithm</span>:** Series of steps used to solve a given problem
>> - **<span style="color: green;">Program</span>:** Series of instructions that tells a computer how to solve a problem. They are written in a specific language such as Python, JavaScript, C#, etc.
>
> **<h2>How Computers Processes/Translates a Programs Code</h2>**
>> - **<span style="color: green;">Interpreted Language</span>:** Interpreters process programs a little bit at a time, reading lines and performing computations. An example of this is Python
>> - **<span style="color: green;">Compiled Language</span>:** A Compiler reads the whole program at once, and then translates it completely into machine code, before starting to run the program. Examples are: Java, SQL, C++


>
>**<h2>What is Python</h1>**
>> Python is a high level, interpreted language. It's considered to be high-level because it is similar to a spoken language. **Python is:**
>> - Quicker to write
>> - Shorter
>> - Easier to read
